I view teaching as a core part of my responsibilities to equip students with an interdisciplinary skillset to build a more just and sustainable world.  I especially enjoy teaching courses that help students integrate multiple frameworks and tools to address a real-world problem.  At Columbia University, the University of Oxford and Princeton University, I have served as a teaching assistant in a variety of departments, including environmental studies and international development.  I have also co-developed a novel course, Climate Change and Conflict, which integrates climate and political science to examine how climate change will influence cooperation and conflict within and among nation-states.

updates on the 2024 training school will follow soon!

Climate Change and Human Mobility ( 2024 )
------
Lecturer of a graduate course that examines the role of climate change on human mobility from a climate science, policy and human geography perspective.  Joint appointment between the United Nations University and the University of Bonn. 

Climate Change and Conflict ( 2023 )
------
I co-created a course on climate change and conflict with Dr. Ethan Kapstein and Prof. Kristopher Ramsey from the Empirical Studies of Conflict Project at Princeton University to examine the intersections between climate science and political science. 


Como Training School on Compound Events ( 2022 )
------
Led a group project together with [Prof. Radley Horton](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/radley-m-horton) on modeling pathways linking compound extremes and human displacement in the context of the 2022 Pakistan floods.

Several guest lectures and applied projects for Master students of the [Environmental Change and Management](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/graduate/msc-ecm/) course. Introduction to attribution science with exercises using the KMNI [Climate Explorer](https://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi).

Geography Taster Day ( 2020 )
------
I also enjoyed conducting a participatory class experiment and the lecture that I gave on educational migration for Year 12 students of under-represented backgrounds during the 2020 Geography Taster Day at my college, Christ Church (Oxford University). 

Dryland migration webinar ( 2019 )
------
United Nations University, Drought Impacts: Migration

The webinar investigated the interlinkage between drought and migration, exploring how drought affects vulnerability and the ability of communities to cope with the impacts of drought, [details here](https://grow-globedrought.net/webinar/drought-impacts-i-migration/). A recording can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEll0hJVEmc).


UNIQ Summer School ( 2018 )

Introduction to the [CLIVAR VACS Climate Atlas](https://www.clivar.org/panels-and-working-groups/africa/vacs).
A memorable guest seminar was one that I taught on "CLIVAR VACS Climate Atlas" to a class of prospective undergraduate students at the School of Geography and the Environment in Oxford as part of the UNIQ summer school (see photo).
