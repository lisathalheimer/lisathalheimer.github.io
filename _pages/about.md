I am a senior researcher in climate science at the <a href='https://ehs.unu.edu/' target="_blank">United Nations University - Institute for Environment and Human Security </a> in Bonn, Germany. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University's Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (<a href='https://cpree.princeton.edu/people/lisa-thalheimer' target="_blank">C-PREE</a>), advised by Prof. Michael Oppenheimer. I obtained my DPhil  in Extreme Event Attribution and Climate Econometrics from the University of Oxford, advised by <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/f.otto' target="_blank">Prof. Fredi Otto</a>, and obtained a MS in <a href='https://www.sustainability.ei.columbia.edu/' target="_blank">Sustainability Management</a> from Columbia University. 

My research approach is strongly interdisciplinary and collaborative, integrating numerical models and data science methods from extreme event attribution and climate econometrics to answer research questions related to estimating the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations and environments. 

The main questions that underlie my ongoing research activities include: 
\
1)	Whether and to what extent does anthropogenic climate change impact the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and resulting human vulnerabilities? 
\
2)	What are the human responses and health-related sensitivities to climate change? 
\
3)	What disaster risk reduction mechanisms prepare populations before natural hazards turn into disasters?

In my spare time, I can be found hiking in the woods with my 1-year old, learning Yiddish (or trying to?) and embracing 'ready, steady, cook' sessions, creating new recipes from leftovers.
