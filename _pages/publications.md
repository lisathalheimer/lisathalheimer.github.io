**L. Thalheimer**; Schwarz, M.; and Pretis, F. (2023). [Large weather and conflict effects on internal displacement in Somalia with little evidence of feedback onto conflict](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378023000079), *Global Environmental Change*, 79, 102641.\\

*We analyze the effect of weather, drought and conflict on internal displacement in Somalia. We find that a 1°C temperature increase can cause a tenfold increase in displaced people. If average monthly rainfall declined from 100 mm to 50 mm, predicted numbers for internally displaced populations in Somalia doubled.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Extreme weather and conflict may drive forced displacement. However, their individual contribution to displacement is not fully understood due to challenges around isolating individual channels of causality. Here, we use novel disaggregated data on internal displacement in all of Somalia’s subregions from 2016 to 2018 broken down by reported reason of displacement and combine it with weather and conflict data. This allows us to isolate the effects of extreme weather and conflict on forced displacement, as well as the effects of displacement on conflict itself. We find large non-linear effects of weather on displacement where an increase in temperature anomalies from 1 °C to 2 °C (to approx. 1.5 standard deviations, SD) leads to a tenfold increase in displaced people, and a reduction in precipitation from 50 mm to 0 mm (approx. 1.5SD) leads to around a fourfold increase in displacement. We find significant effects of conflict events on displacement (which are masked when the data is aggregated) with a 1.5 standard deviation increase in conflict events increasing displacement 50-fold. We further show that displacement itself has little detectable effect on the occurrence of conflict events.

\
*We analyze the impacts of compound risks (i.e. multiple climate and social factors that threaten livelihoods) on migration responses to drought in Madagascar, Mexico, and Nepal. We find that the net climate-migration relationship depends on social factors e.g. access to irrigation, accurate information, and social connections.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Extreme dry events already disrupt populations’ ability to migrate. In a warming climate, compound drought events could amplify vulnerability and drive forced migration. Here, we contribute the first multi-method research design on societal impacts from compound drought events. We show how mobility patterns are shaped by the intersection of drought and social vulnerability factors in three drought-prone countries – Madagascar, Nepal, and Mexico. We find that internal migration in agricultural communities in Mexico increased by 14 to 24 basis points from 1991 to 2018 and will prospectively increase by 2 to 15 basis points in Nepal in case of a compound drought event in 2025. We show that consecutive drought events exacerbate structural vulnerabilities, limiting migrants’ adaptation options, including long-range migration. We conclude that the additional social pre-conditions, e.g., social isolation and lack of accurate information, ultimately limit migration as an adaptation option for households vulnerable to compound drought events.
